# Free TailwindCSS NextJS landing page template

This is a free landing page template built with **TailwindCSS** and powered by **React / Next.js**. It includes all the essential components you need to quickly build a modern, responsive landing page for SaaS products, online services, and more.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Inter](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
